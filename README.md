# PlantClassificationApp

## Description:
This application will show a GUI with a main page for searching the dataset and a secondary page for uploading entries to the dataset. On the main page, the user can search the dataset for specific species by name or by setting filters and clicking the search button. The name of the species can be typed into the search bar, returning all entries in the dataset filed under that name. The user can also search for specific tags associated with the entries. On the second page, the user can upload their image, providing a name, a description of the plant, and any relevant tags (ex. height, flowering, fruiting, respiration type (C3, C4), reproductive type, etc.).

  This application will display a GUI to the user. The GUI will have two pages, one for searching and the other for uploading entries. When the user is on the search page they will see a search bar where they can type the name of a specific plant species, multiple filter buttons, a preview of the returned images, a search button, and an upload button. If the user only provides the name of the species, then the program will return all entries under that name. If the user only searches using filters, then the program will return all entries with the associated tags. Otherwise, the name and tags can be used in conjunction for more refined searching. The results of the search will be displayed on this page for the user to browse through.
  On the upload page, the user can provide their image to be added to the dataset. The user will have to specify a name for the entry along with any relevant tags. At this point, the user can also choose to provide a description of their image. Clicking the upload button at this point will add the entry to the dataset.
