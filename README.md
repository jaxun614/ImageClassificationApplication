# Image Classification Application

## Description:

This application will handle the searching and uploading of images, providing the user with an intuitive GUI for both functions. The search page will display the images in the dataset in the order they were added by default. Searches can be refined by typing dates or setting categorically appropriate tags. The user can click on the search results to see more detailed information about the image that can be edited. The user can also upload their images to the dataset by setting categories, descriptions, tags, etc.
